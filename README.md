GuardURL - Smart Threat Detection Dashboard
GuardURL is a smart web-based tool developed using Machine Learning that helps users check if a URL is safe or potentially malicious, specifically detecting SQL Injection (SQLi) 
and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
This project was built as part of an AI/ML internship focused on network security

 Features :
 
   1. Detects malicious URLs using a trained ML model.

   
   2. Classifies attack type: SQLi, XSS, or Unknown.

   
   3. Shows prediction confidence and attack type.

   
   4. Supports bulk upload of URLs as CSV.

   
   5. Displays pie chart of safe vs malicious results.
 
 Requirements:
 
   1. Python

   
   2. Streamlit – for building the interactive dashboard

   
   3. scikit-learn – for model training and prediction

   
   4. pandas – for data processing

   
   5. matplotlib – for visual charts

   
   6 joblib – for saving/loading models
